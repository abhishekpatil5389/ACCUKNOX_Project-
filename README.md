# ACCUKNOX_Project_System_Health_Monitoring_Script

This Python script monitors system resource usage and ensures they stay within defined thresholds. It checks CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and the number of running processes. If any metric exceeds its threshold, the script prints a warning message. The script uses subprocess to run system commands and parse their outputs for real-time monitoring.
